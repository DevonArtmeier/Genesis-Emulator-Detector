# Sega Genesis Emulator Detector
This is my emulator detector for the Sega Genesis that I made back in 2019. It can detect multiple emulators and check if it's being run on actual hardware. I made this primarily as an exercise in programming and researching emulators, but it has helped a few emulator developers iron out some kinks to make them more accurate.

Detects:
* Kega Fusion
* Regen
* Genesis Plus GX
* Gens
* Exodus
* Picodrive
* Genecyst
* AtGames Flashback
* AtGames Firecore
* Sega's Steam emulator
* Mega Sg (Old versions)
* BlastEm (Old versions)

Special thanks to Matt Philips (BigEvilCorporation) for the AtGames detection code.
